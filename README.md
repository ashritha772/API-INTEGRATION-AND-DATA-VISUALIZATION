##DESCRIPTION

This project demonstrates fetching real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, processing it with Python (Pandas), and visualizing trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Tasks Completed
1. API Integration
Fetched 5-day forecasts (3-hour intervals) via requests.

Retrieved temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions.

Handled JSON parsing and error responses.

2. Data Processing
Structured raw JSON into a Pandas DataFrame.

Converted timestamps to readable datetime format.

Cleaned and filtered relevant columns for visualization.

3. Data Visualization
Line plots for temperature trends.

Dual-axis plots (humidity + pressure).

Bar charts for wind speed.

Pie charts for weather condition distribution.

4. Dashboard Creation
Combined 4 subplots into a single dashboard.

Added titles, labels, legends, and styling (Seaborn themes).

Exported data to CSV for further analysis.

Technologies Used
Python (Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

OpenWeatherMap API (Free tier)

VS Code (Development Environment)

Outcome
✅ Successfully built an automated weather dashboard.
✅ Demonstrated API integration + ETL + Visualization pipeline.
✅ Ready for extension (e.g., multi-city comparison, live updates).
